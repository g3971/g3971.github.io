				<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
				<p>
					My main interest in IT is with regards to VR/AR development, and AI. I really believe in VR being the future for many things. My interest in IT started when I got a computer virus trying to download a video game, ‘Minecraft’, for free as a kid. I panicked when I first got it and my cousin did a clean install of windows for me. This event sparked my interest in IT and after that I did a lot of research on computer viruses and how to avoid them and since then I’ve always had a fire in me for all things computers. As for my IT experience, it is very limited but I hope to expand it in this course.
				</p>
				<p>
				I chose to come to <strong>[redacted]</strong>because it has a great reputation for IT and Engineering, and I’ve heard lots of good things about it from <strong>[redacted]</strong> who studied here before. I was also very pleased when I saw the <strong>[redacted]</strong>offered through <strong>[redacted]</strong>. All this made the decision to choose to study at <strong>[redacted]</strong> a very easy one.
				</p>
				<p>
					During my studies, I expect to get a very good and broad introduction to all things IT, and I also hope to be able to have a good foundation to be able to learn the IT skills needed for most IT jobs out there. I expect that my foundation will allow me to expand my limits so that I am able to progress further and further.

				<img id="job-photo" src="https://g3971.github.io/images/job-photo.png" alt=""/>
				<p>
					An employee in this position is expected to create XR (extended reality) programs for Esri, a GIS (Geographic Information System) company. A Geographic Information System provides data/information about the geography of land. I’ve always loved the land and anything to do with it, as a result of that love I acquired a Certificate II in Horticulture, which is relevant to land management and the types of geographic information systems Esri provides. This, along with my very strong interest in VR/AR, and my motivation to make a difference through my work, make this job ideal for me. 
				</p>
				<p>
				The skills, qualifications, and experience required for this job are substantial, but achievable. An applicant for the role is expected to have 2 years of experience in software development (I currently have no experience), experience in working with Unity (I have very basic Unity experience) and working with a team (I have experience working with a team, but not for IT purposes which is probably what they expect), experience with C# or C++ for mobile app development (I have no experience with C# or C++ for anything), knowledge and familiarity with the Agile methodology (I know what it is, but I’ve never used it), knowledge of GIS and Esri’s products (I know nothing about Esri’s products but I know about GIS), as well as a relevant bachelor’s or master’s degree (I don’t have a degree but I hope I will attain it here at <strong>[redacted]</strong>).
				</p>
				<p>
					To obtain the skills required for the job, I will complete my Bachelor’s degree in IT, as well as ensure that in this time I learn more about XR technologies and GIS, and get experience with C# and/or C++ for mobile app development. I will also aim to get more experience in Unity development, starting with my IT project below. I will also make sure I know how to work in a team well and use the Agile methodology to do so. I will do this by taking my group and team work for group assignments seriously. All in all, it is a long journey, but I think that through consistent effort and motivation it is
achievable.

				</article>
				<p>
					The results of this test show that I am quite introverted, with a tendency towards intuition and emotion. They show that I am analytical, and prefer order and schedule rather than chaos or disorder. They also show that emotionally, I am relatively stable, and I prefer to keep a small group of friends rather than be with many groups or a big group. They also show that I prefer to work alone rather than in a team or a group, and prefer a smaller team rather than a bigger team.
				</p>
				<p>
					I believe that in a team, I will tend to take my task and work on it alone before meeting up with the team to discuss my findings/results, rather than working together directly on the same task with others. I also believe that tasks that require analysis will be more suited for me, and that I might not feel very inclined to socialise with others, certainly not as much as someone who is more extroverted might feel inclined to. Furthermore, I will prefer a team that has order and possibly a schedule and good division of work, and will struggle to work in a disorderly team.
				</p>
				<p>
					To take this into account, when forming a team I should ensure that the members’ goals and vision for the team align with mine, i.e. being orderly and work well split, and having meetings to discuss and put our work together but not working together 100% of the time. I also believe that this means I might not fit in as well with teams that need someone who will be socialising a lot, but that I will fit in very well with teams who might also be introverted and socialise less.
				</p>
				<p>
					Having said all that, my interpretations are subjective and so should not be used as a concrete or final step – more thought should be put into this, and the results themselves might not be completely valid, especially given how diverse we all are and how we can differ from day to day. The tests try their best to account for this but ultimately, like most things, they are not perfect.

				<h2>Project Idea</h2>
				<section id="project-overview">
					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p>
						The project idea is a ‘center for learning,’ which contains rooms with VR headsets and controllers, with software to facilitate learning of workforce-relevant or communityenriching skills such as welding, metalworking, gardening, sewing, etc. It is the project’s primary goal that the skills learned in the facility will help end-users gain employment.
					</p>
					<p>
						These ‘centers’ will be located in communities and their localities and available for a fee or for free if local governments choose to fund them. This will allow members of those communities to learn skills in an affordable, novel, and intuitive manner. This will result in more skilled employees and a bigger variety of available services in communities, opportunities for residents to learn these skills, and as a result, the enrichment of these communities.
					</p>
					<p>
						For the sake of feasibility, this project will only comprise of the development of the software to be used to facilitate the learning, and will not include things such as the designs and/or construction of the center and its contents.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="project-motivation">
					<h3>Motivation</h3>
					<p>
						The current national unemployment rate in Australia is 5.4%. Globally it varies between 6% to 7%. In some countries the unemployment rate can reach 25%. Along with this unemployment issue there are many people around the world who may be retired, a stay-at-home mom or dad, or a teenager with time to spare, who may want to learn some new skills to have a good time and be able to enrich their communities (e.g. by opening a business, taking care of local gardens, etc.). Furthermore, education is currently quite expensive and does not cater to all learning styles. This leaves a gap in the education market for these students. Another issue is that indemand skills vary from community to community (e.g. some localities may need more construction workers, some may need more assembly workers, some may need more weavers, etc.), leaving a big gap in the employment market in many localities.
					</p>
					<p>
						This project aims to address these issues and fill in the gap in these markets, providing this much-needed service (affordable and novel education) for consumers in communities and localities around the world.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="project-description">
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>
						This in-depth description of the service provided in the ‘center of learning,’ briefly described above, will comprise several key elements. These include:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Method of Learning</li>
						<li>Workforce-relevant and community-enriching skills</li>
						<li>Novelty of experience</li>
						<li>Ease of Use</li>
						<li>Affordability and Value</li>
						<li>Technical Requirements and Implementation</li>
					</ul>
					<h4 id="project-description-method">Method of Learning</h4>
					<p>
						The method for learning skills through this service will be via Virtual Reality (VR) software. A VR headset along with two controllers will be provided in rooms within a building for customers to use. Software for learning certain skills as relevant in that community will be installed on those VR headsets for customers to use. Eventually, it is hoped that these customers will be able to use their skills for employment and enrichment in their communities.
					</p>
					<h4 id="project-description-workforce">Workforce-relevant and community-enriching skills</h4>
					<p>
						As a result of the criteria for skills provided in this service being that they either have to be workforce-relevant or community-enriching, the service will provide two main types of skills: Workforce-relevant skills, and community-enriching skills. Often, there will be much overlap between the two.
					</p>
					<h5 id="project-description-workforce-workforce">Workforce-relevant skills</h5>
					<p>
						Workforce-relevant skills, are those skills that are relevant to the current workforce and aim to meet the demand for employment within those areas of expertise. This may be achieved through keeping open a channel of communication with local employers within communities to find which skills are in-demand or urgently needed, and then providing the service for learning those in-demand skills.
					</p>
					<h5 id="project-description-workforce-community">Community-enriching skills</h5>
					<p>
						Community-enriching skills, are those skills which enrich the community within which they are learned. These might include taking care of local gardens, running a local business, keeping watch in the community and knowing what to report to authorities, knowing the rights of residents of the community, etc. This may be achieved through keeping open communication with the residents of those communities to understand what skills they feel will enrich their communities, and then providing the service for learning those skills.
					</p>
					<h4 id="project-description-ease">Ease of use</h4>
					<p>
						The service must be easy to use even for customers with little knowledge of computer operation. The service’s usage must be intuitive, from the very first step customers take inside the ‘center for learning,’ to the moment they step out.
					</p>
					<h4 id="project-description-novelty">Novelty of Experience</h4>
					<p>
						The service must provide a novel and rewarding experience for customers, to facilitate effective, long-lasting, and enriching learning. This may be achieved through various techniques, from captivating virtual environments to procedural generation (to make each customer’s experience unique).
					</p>
					<h4 id="project-description-affordability">Affordability and Value</h4>
					<h5 id="project-description-affordability-affordability">Affordability</h5>
					<p>
						The service must be affordable to allow for those most in need of in-demand skills to access it. This affordability may be achieved through various means, such as a low cost, or an option for customers to take a loan and pay for the loan once they are employed.
					</p>
					<h5 id="project-description-affordability-value">Value</h5>
					<p>
						The service must provide excellent value for customers and the local communities within which it will be deployed. This will be done by consistently keeping the service subject to the highest level of auditing and analysis, and constant revisions and improvements to satisfy the results of the audits and analysis done on the service.
					</p>
					<h4 id="project-description-technical">Technical Requirements and Implementation</h4>
					<p>
						The technical requirements within the scope of this project are detailed in the table below.
					</p>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<th>Requirement</th>
							<th>Description</th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Compatibility</td>
							<td>The software must be compatible and work with modern headsets and XR APIs such as WebXR, as well as be compatible with SteamVR. Compatibility with these APIs will ensure compatibility with most modern headsets.<a href="#footer"><sup>3,4</sup></a></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Simplicity</td>
							<td>The software must be simple to use and work on simple systems, and work with standalone headsets (no requirement for a PC). This may be ensured through compatibility with WebXR.<a href="#footer"><sup>5</sup></a></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Menu</td>
							<td>The software must have a menu with basic menu features such as Start, Quit, Options, etc. and also allow for selection of different skills to learn.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>UI</td>
							<td>The user UI must allow for accessibility for those with issues such as color vision and some common disabilities such as those causing issues with basic motor skills.</td>
						</tr>
					</table>

				<section id="project-tools">
					<h3>Tools and Technology</h3>
					<p>
						The tools and technology required for this project comprise two sections: Software, and Hardware. For each section, there are two categories: Software and hardware used for development, and software and hardware used for the end user headset.
					</p>
					<h4 id="project-tools-software">Software</h4>
					<h5 id="project-tools-software-development">Development</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>A platform to develop the VR programs. For this project Unity will be used.</li>
						<li>OpenVR to assist development and allow the software to be used with most currently on-the-market VR Headsets</li>
						<li>XR Toolkit 2.0 to implement interactions between controllers and objects as well as objects and other objects in the VR software.</li>
					</ul>
					<h5 id="project-tools-software-end">End User</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>The headset used by the end users will only need the software developed in this project to be installed.</li>
					</ul>
					<h4 id="project-tools-hardware">Hardware</h4>
					<h5 id="project-tools-hardware-development">Development</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>A computer will be needed to run Unity and develop the software.</li>
						<li>A VR headset will be needed to test the software and ensure it works as intended.</li>
					</ul>
					<h5 id="project-tools-hardware-end">End User</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>A VR headset will be required to run the software. This will be provided for endusers at the ‘center for learning.’</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section id="project-skills">
					<h3>Skills Required</h3>
					<p>
						The skills required for this project fall into two categories: Unity development and Programming, both of which will be discussed below. Furthermore, feasibility will also be discussed in this section.
					</p>
					<h4 id="project-skills-unity">Unity Development</h4>
					<p>
						Skills in Unity development will be required for this project. The software will need to be made and deployed using Unity.
					</p>
					<h4 id="project-skills-programming">Programming</h4>
					<p>
						The two programming languages, C# and C++, will both be used to program components of the software alongside Unity.
					</p>
					<h4 id="project-skills-feasibility">Feasibility</h4>
					<p>
						It is very feasible to find the skills and software required for this project, as it only requires a freely available software(a free license is enough for this project’s current scope), Unity, and basic programming in C# and C++, for which the required level of expertise for this project can be learned in a moderate length of time.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="outcome">
					<h3>Outcome</h3>
					<p>
						Should this project be successful, communities around the world will have ‘centers for learning’ in which residents of those communities will be able to go into to learn various in-demand skills using VR. Ideally, learning these skills will help those residents earn employment and/or enrich their community.
					</p>
					<p>
						The problem of a lack of supply for many in-demand skills and a relatively high unemployment rate would be solved because this project will provide supply for those in-demand skills and will provide employment in those communities, meeting the demand for supply for those skills.
					</p>
					<p>
						Ultimately, communities in which this project solution is deployed will, in being able to quickly teach certain skills through this solution, be more able to deal with sudden influxes in demand for certain skill-sets, have lower unemployment rates, and have a better supply for in-demand skills within their locality.
