				<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
				<p>
					My main interest in IT is with regards to VR/AR development, and AI. I really believe in VR being the future for many things. My interest in IT started when I got a computer virus trying to download a video game, ‘Minecraft’, for free as a kid. I panicked when I first got it and my cousin did a clean install of windows for me. This event sparked my interest in IT and after that I did a lot of research on computer viruses and how to avoid them and since then I’ve always had a fire in me for all things computers. As for
my IT experience, it is very limited but I hope to expand it in this course.
				</p>
				<p>
				I chose to come to <strong>[redacted]</strong>because it has a great reputation for IT and Engineering, and I’ve heard lots of good things about it from <strong>[redacted]</strong> who studied here before. I was also very pleased when I saw the <strong>[redacted]</strong>offered through <strong>[redacted]</strong>. All this made the decision to choose to study at <strong>[redacted]</strong> a very easy one.
				</p>
				<p>
					During my studies, I expect to get a very good and broad introduction to all things IT, and I also hope to be able to have a good foundation to be able to learn the IT skills needed for most IT jobs out there. I expect that my foundation will allow me to
expand my limits so that I am able to progress further and further.

				<h2>Ideal Job</h2>

					An employee in this position is expected to create XR (extended reality) programs for Esri, a GIS (Geographic Information System) company. A Geographic Information System provides data/information about the geography of land. I’ve always loved the land and anything to do with it, as a result of that love I acquired a Certificate II in Horticulture, which is relevant to land management and the types of geographic information systems Esri provides. This, along with my very strong interest in VR/AR, and
my motivation to make a difference through my work, make this job ideal for me. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The skills, qualifications, and experience required for this job are substantial, but achievable. An applicant for the role is expected to have 2 years of experience in software development (I currently have no experience), experience in working with
Unity (I have very basic Unity experience) and working with a team (I have experience working with a team, but not for IT purposes which is probably what they expect), experience with C# or C++ for mobile app development (I have no experience with C# or C++ for anything), knowledge and familiarity with the Agile methodology (I know what it is, but I’ve never used it), knowledge of GIS and Esri’s products (I know nothing about Esri’s products but I know about GIS), as well as a relevant bachelor’s or master’s degree (I don’t have a degree but I hope I will attain
it here at RMIT).
				</p>
				<p>
					To obtain the skills required for the job, I will complete my Bachelor’s degree in IT, as well as ensure that in this time I learn more about XR technologies and GIS, and get experience with C# and/or C++ for mobile app development. I will also aim to get more experience in Unity development, starting with my IT project below. I will also make sure I know how to work in a team well and use the Agile methodology to do so. I will do this by taking my group and team work for group assignments seriously. All in all, it is a long journey, but I think that through consistent effort and motivation it is
achievable.

				</article>
				<p>
					The results of this test show that I am quite introverted, with a tendency towards intuition and emotion. They show that I am analytical, and prefer order and schedule rather than chaos or disorder. They also show that emotionally, I am relatively stable, and I prefer to keep a small group of friends rather than be with many groups or a big group. They also show that I prefer to work alone rather than in a team or a group,
and prefer a smaller team rather than a bigger team.
				</p>
				<p>
					I believe that in a team, I will tend to take my task and work on it alone before meeting up with the team to discuss my findings/results, rather than working together directly on the same task with others. I also believe that tasks that require analysis will be more suited for me, and that I might not feel very inclined to socialise with others, certainly not as much as someone who is more extroverted might feel inclined to. Furthermore, I will prefer a team that has order and possibly a schedule and good
division of work, and will struggle to work in a disorderly team.
				</p>
				<p>
					To take this into account, when forming a team I should ensure that the members’ goals and vision for the team align with mine, i.e. being orderly and work well split, and having meetings to discuss and put our work together but not working together 100% of the time. I also believe that this means I might not fit in as well with teams that need someone who will be socialising a lot, but that I will fit in very well with teams
who might also be introverted and socialise less.
				</p>
				<p>
					Having said all that, my interpretations are subjective and so should not be used as a concrete or final step – more thought should be put into this, and the results themselves might not be completely valid, especially given how diverse we all are and how we can differ from day to day. The tests try their best to account for this but ultimately, like most things, they are not perfect.
